            <p>Kavya, I just want to take a moment to appreciate everything you bring into our friendship.You always give your bestâ€”whether itâ€™s in the little things or the big momentsâ€”and thatâ€™s something I truly respect. I know that along the way, there were times I could have understood you better or handled things differently, and for that, Iâ€™m genuinely sorry. No friendship is perfect, but what we have is real, and Iâ€™ll always be grateful for the bond we share. No matter where life takes us, Iâ€™ll always hold onto the good memories and appreciate the kindness, patience, and honesty you show. You truly are an amazing friend, and I hope you always find the happiness and peace you deserve.ðŸŒŸ</p>

            <p>Muskii,

I know that over time, my insecurities and overthinking hurt you in ways I never intended. I let my fears and emotions take over, and in that process, I made you feel uncomfortable, maybe even burdened, with my reactions. I never wanted to control you or make things difficult, but I now realize that my words and actions might have done just that. I was so scared of losing the bond we shared that I ended up pushing you away instead.  

I should have trusted our friendship more instead of letting my insecurities get in the way. I let my fears of being replaced and my frustration cloud my judgment, and I reacted in ways that were unfair to you. But please know, it was never because I didnâ€™t value youâ€”it was because I valued you too much and didnâ€™t know how to handle my emotions the right way.  

I can see now how all of this must have affected you, and I truly regret it. The last thing I ever wanted was for you to feel suffocated or hurt because of me. I just wish I had been able to show my care in a way that didnâ€™t feel overwhelming to you. I am really sorry for all the times I made things harder instead of easier, for all the words I spoke in frustration that I canâ€™t take back now.  

I donâ€™t expect you to forget everything, but I just want you to know that I see where I went wrong, and Iâ€™m working on myselfâ€”not just for you, but for me too. No matter where we stand today, I still care about you just as much, and I hope one day, youâ€™ll remember me not for my mistakes but for the friend who truly cherished you.ðŸ’”</p>
